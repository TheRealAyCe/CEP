$ Kharg <--- Kharg is money
* AyCe  <--- AyCe's a star
# Henry <--- Henry is a crossword for us

$ Ninja Monkey as SEAS scout ----> Let's make the sentinel be the only scout
* Yes, I think it should be like this. We have to think of a use for Ninja Monkey then ^^
# do we really need to use 'every' model?
* Yes :D Well, perhaps? As an easteregg?

$ Funtitans <--Remove
* True, they are overpowered but also difficult to obtain and they don't really fit in the game.

$ Pirate Harbour <---Remove
* Pirate ships are overpowered and hovercrafts (or whatever they are) are useless?
$ Keep pirate ship, change cargo lifter to something else...
* Perhaps harbour trader? Isnt it a flying unit?

$ Change Babbit T4 in something better 
* Does he still have the outpost? Because that one is not completely useless. However... noone will build this anyway.

$ Remove the useless units, why should Miyagi give 3 special units?
* Yes

$ Governon SEAS T4: Norsemen wall doesn't really fit, an upgrade maybe? same as Norsemen? but Electricity instead of rocks or Icing walls :D  or Defensive field against siege projectiles?
* Now that we can modify usls, it's time to try out some objects as walls ^^

#: we should do something with tarna riders to make them somehow more special/better (and not to look so bad...)
* We could give them special abilities (like leap on an enemy, etc)
$ I had the same idea, special moves like roar and more :)

#: not so important, but maybe we should rethink water special units (miyagi and babbit t4 for dc) -> they are useless on no-watermaps
* Hmm. Kleemann DC would be useless too...
# true
$ In my opinion they are fine as they are now....



$ In an earlier version I added 2 new treasures, should we use them? Or maybe we should make more...
# They are used, aren't they? :S	
$No maps uses them at the moment...

$Cargo lifter as a standard unit for every tribe? Works as naval trading? or maybe a mini zeppelin? flies only if an unit is inside andcan transport only 1 unit :P
#Don't know... cargo lifter is kinda like amazon temple, it only fits one tribe (this case dc)
$Then what about an upgrade to make fishing boats be the merchants? that would be cool :P
#yes
