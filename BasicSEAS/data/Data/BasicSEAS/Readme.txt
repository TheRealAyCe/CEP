BasicSEAS PW modification
by AyCe
----------------------------

This mod just takes the Boosterpack and "adds" the SEAS to the available players.
It does not fix bugs, so it's highly advised to use the CEP instead!


Changelog:

BasicSEAS 1.0.0 - 7th March 2013
-------------------------------------
- tribeicon_SEAS fixed
- removed SEAS-exclusion from tribeselection
- added SEK-Maps-SEAS-hack by Henry
- PointBuy bug fix (?) so SEAS can be selected
