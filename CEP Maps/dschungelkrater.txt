Fantastic landscape, good wild animal choices, lots or resourses however building space on main hq islands are very little, needs work, maybe larger hq islands but otherwise fantastic
Make HQ islands larger for more building space as HQ 1 is at an advantage in building space
However I could rate it A as it could be faced as a good challenge
Group A/B
English Name: Jungle Crater
HQ Advantage: 1
Because of the fact it has more building space
Tribe Advantage: Aje
