First of all: AutoIt3 is a very nice "programming language" for simple
tools and stuff. That's nice. However, it cannot handle multithreading.

What's that?
When checking for updates, we need 2 things to happen at the same moment:
1. Display the CEP-Launcher-Window, handle user input
2. Check for an update version. Internet may be slow, so this could take a
looong time!
We cannot handle these things together, multithreading would be needed.
However, we CAN fake it! That's where version_checker.exe starts:
Whenever the CEP-Launcher is started, version_checker.exe is started as well.
While the Launcher displays its userinterface, the versionchecker reads a
file on our server which contains update information. It then saves them to
a file (updateinfo.txt) so the Launcher can check if that file exists. If
it does, the Launcher can check if that version differs from his own version.
If it does, he can display a message, stating that the user should update.


Format of the para-welt.com/cep/version.txt
Values are seperated by tabulators:
1. "versioncheck" so the launcher sees this file is valid
2. Name of latest version
3. Website version format number
4. Currently unused, build number (each update, no matter what version number,
increments this value by 1)
