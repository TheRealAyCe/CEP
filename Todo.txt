- More Maps especially Singleplayer!

- Icon for seas_bunker
  Description for ES, FR

- Description for jumpjet (every lang)

- various localizations missing for: ES, FR

- single_seas_02 descriptions missing for: ES, FR

- single_seas_02 Diary Entry missing for: ES, FR


Very important (This release!):
- Plz consider: Effects.usl merely removes Flash-Effects and used CBloodHit instead of CFlashHit for Hits (that turn PW into new year)
  MAYBE we should remove it from CEP? Or at least change it, so that CResCharacterSpawnFX, CBigAnimalDeathPingFX etc do something again
- Synkro: Fix Seq bugs
- Turret Bunker: seas_bunker is like seas_hq_bunker, Upgrade -> Gets Turret & Changes the desc
  -> Maybe not...
- Localize jumpjet
- Decide: Flamethrowers really ep 3 ?
- AyCe: Fix BfPW HL Miyagi spawn (special_miyagi) and conditions...
- AyCe: Fix some maps (henry put them in a file)
- Remove the old changelog button in launcher.
- Fix SEAS handicap bug (in maps where seas are forcely enabled by usl hacks the handicap doesn't work)
 
Quite important (This or next release):
- Fix place used for some SEAS Buildings (like steelwork)
- Big tent smaller space needed?
- Make Riders & Dunkleos useful (they're strong, at least)
- Bunker is too big... heal? coastal?
- Tent repair & carrier repair is difficult
- Buildup-Animation for: seas_outpost, seas_bunker, seas_mg_nest, seas_defense_turret
  -> Maybe different Babbit T4? However, keep the outpost, I need it for a mission
  -> Would also be cool if it had a turret on top
- Destruct-Animations for Non-Animated Buildings
  - Khargclub, Outpost, Laboratory, Pirate harbour, etc.
- CO-OP Menu
- Add CZ Language to BP2.0 (see folder in Henry-PW Modding)
- Add seas carrier in the bonus list of various treasures regarding ships


Not important but nice:
- AI should use carrier for fishing (if food is needed, otherwise it should guard base)
- AI asks for large sums of resources.
- No "New epoch available" when buildings are needed for it (also, maybe the AC-bar is not updating when such a building is built?)
- SEAS Gunner: Description says armor piercing, but isn't (also, it's useless)
- (SEAS) gate has "destruct" button looking pressed (only when attacked?) after some seconds
- Aje infantry has build/repair speechacks. Use them?
- Rally Point for certain buildings don't update properly on click on client (Laboratory). Shown position is 1 click before. Reclick BLDG to see real position.
- Save replays and maybe savegames in a separate folder
- Add CEP-items to localization
- Add a merge function for the Localizer
- Fix the namebug when a player leaves the game
- Add a portal to para-welt.com
- Add the SEAS Gatling Bunker (like in Zoos map) and Sandbag-Gatlings
- Balancing: SEAS Building costs
- Visibility is changed for some units, but the condition is NOT SET! -> AI can build units although they aren't visible for a human player yet
- BuildUp & destruction "animations" for those new buildings
- SEAS Sandbag MG
- AdaptTerrain/ChatEvt is not secured against cheats (any modded client could call it during a game!)
