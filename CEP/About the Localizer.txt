The PW Localizer is an awesome tool written by AyCe, which enables you
to translate text easily and build it all as LMF & the language-
dependent LTFs. Okay, so here's how you use it:

First of all, start the EXE. Note you will need Java in order to work
with it.
After some seconds you will see a window, which you should maximize.
The table still is empty. You have two ways to fill it: Loading an
existing Loc-file, or creating a new one.
I will explain all functions now:

File/New
Basically deletes everything and resets the filepath, which means you
can now create a new Loc-file. The old content is not saved though!

File/Open...
Open an existing Loc-file. The standard file for CEP is
"CEP_standard.loc" and is located in the same directory as the program.

File/Save
Quicksave your file. CTRL+S also works.

File/Save As...
Save your file under a name you choose. Will be forced when file hasn't
been saved yet and quicksave is used.

File/Import OLD Loc
Import an old localization file like Localizations.txt with a PropDB-
like structure. This CAN'T read PropDBs though! Open it and a menu will
pop up:
	Reset - Resets all values in the window. Pretty much useless.
	Import file - Choose the file you want to import.
	Insert - Insert the data in the table.
The two text input fields are for the language name and the two language
entity characters (Like "German" and "de"). Imported files or an error
message will be shown in the text field beneath.

File/Import Localized
Does not do anything right now.

File/Exit
Explanation needed?

Edit/New Loc
Inserts a new row which can be used to localize text.

Edit/New Language
Inserts a new column for a new language.

Edit/Edit Language
Brings up a menu which enables you to edit language settings.
Cycle through the languages with the buttons at the top.
The two text inputs beneath are for the language name and code
(eg. "Spanish" and "es"). Change the path for the generated LTF-file
in the text field at the bottom. Click Update to save the values,
although pressing any other of the buttons does the same thing.
With the two other buttons you can change the order of the languages.

Edit/Remove Language
Opens a menu for language deletion. For safety reasons, tick the
checkbox first, and click on the button with the language you want to
delete.

Edit/Move Loc Up
Move the selected Locs one row up. CTRL+O does the same thing.

Edit/Move Loc Down
Move the selected Locs one row down. CTRL+L does the same thing.

Edit/Edit Text
Opens a window with a big text area, useful for editing large texts.
You can also use CTRL+E.

Edit/Settings
Opens the settings window. The checkbox at the top controls if empty
texts will get localized or not (translation will be empty). Main
language overrides the text at Default when building the files.
Insert the code of the language you want to use, otherwise the texts
at Default are used. File Info is just a text field you can write in
whatever you want. Path for the LMF is important when building,
because as with the languages, you have to set a path here.
Press Update when you are done.

Build/Build Localizations
Builds all files and prints the debug output in a text field.

Delete Loc/Remove Loc
Put in an extra tab for safety reasons. Use this to delete a loc-code
and all its translations.


Now to the table itself:
Loc-Code: The loc-code which is used to identify a text ingame.
Default: The default value for unlocalized texts. Can be overriden by
the main language you can set in Edit/Settings. Its default value
is "!DUMMY!".
Number: Unknown number, it most likely resembles how many characters
you should use for a text. Default value for this is 50. Don't insert
high values please!
Description: A note for translators about this loc.

To edit a cell just double-click.
You can also resize the columns as you like them, they will get
reset though if any change in the table structure occurs.
Use CTRL held down to select multiple cells, or SHIFT to select an
end point for a range. Multiple selected cells always have to be next
to each other.

Please note _lmflist.txt and _ltflist.txt have to be set by yourself.
Note also that you will have to maually save when closing the program!


Have fun translating :D
