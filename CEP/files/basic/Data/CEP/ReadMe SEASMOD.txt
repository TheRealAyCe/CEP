SEASMOD 3.6.2 Beta (3 April 2011) by the Para-welt.com Team
===============================================================

Introduction:

This mod adds the ability to play the SEAS in Paraworld
in skirmish, multiplayer, and campaign! To install it, just
execute the installer, it should detect a version of
ParaWorld automatically. If it also asks you if you want to
overwrite the old version, click "Yes"! Then, it may ask you
to keep your army-sets. A new presets.txt may fix bugs,
but normally you can just click "Yes", to keep your
Presets.txt file for the "My Army" screen in multiplayer.

Incompatible with older versions of Paraworld than 1.05.
All players must start SEASMOD for multiplayer games!
